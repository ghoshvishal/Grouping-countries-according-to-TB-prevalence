# Grouping-countries-according-to-TB-prevalence

The dataset given is about TB prevalence, all forms (per 100000 population per year) in different countries. I will be grouping countries based on how similar their situation has been year-by-year to understand the world situation regarding the tuberculosis disease. 

Here, I have used clustering method to cluster countries into 3 groups.

•	Countries with minimum TB Prevalence

•	Countries with medium TB Prevalence

•	Countries with maximum TB Prevalence

I have used KMeans clustering method to cluster all the countries into 3 groups. And then I have taken Decision tree (with PCA) as the best classification model.
